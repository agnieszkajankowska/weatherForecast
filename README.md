Remarks:
1. The app was created starting with 'create-react-app'

Possible improvements:
1.Refactoring of the App.js component code
2.Responsiveness and design improvements
3.Thought on handling the data (forecast data fetched for every three hours - only simplified solution
for choosing the data was implemented. Therefore, the algorithm for extracting
weather forecast should be improved)
4.Further testing of the components
5.Adding location map to weather display
6.Adding graph for weather forecast temperature
